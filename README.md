# Asteroidz
Adds a bunch of on-rails asteroids between Dres and Jool, aswell as some suprises in other places

## Features
This mod aims to give players more places to visit within the Kerbolar system, without signiciantly altering the layout of the classic Kerbol system. The mod features a wide variety of asteroids, both in expected and unexpected places. These asteroids are not physical, meaning you cant move them around. They do however have an SOI, so you can land on them. This mod is designed to play well with future ISRU mods. Some asteroids have special features like rings and moons. Asteroids have different compositions (Icy, Rocky and Carboniferous) and size classes.

## Dependancies
This mod requires [Planety](https://spacedock.info/mod/3781/Planety) to work.

## Download
Extract the zip file into the Planety folder in your game directory.
Planety mods do not affect existing campaigns, so you'll have to start a new one. Make sure 'Asteroidz' is enabled under 'Planety Settings'
